AI can both be our future and our doom.

“AI doesn't have to be evil to destroy humanity – if AI has a goal and humanity
just happens in the way, it will destroy humanity as a matter of course without
even thinking about it, no hard feelings." – Elon Musk

To a certain extent the part "AI doesnt have to be eveil to destroy humanity" is true as thast the way humans would have developed AIs, so work through any sort of problems that human might not be able to and because of that humans can come in the way of our own creation as we arent capable of doing certain things these AIs can.

AI being able to feel things emotionally just like us humans is still yet a controversial subject, as they may be able to feel some in the future but not sure if they will be able to fully replicate human emotions. So thats  where the "no hard feelings" comes in. Most human action can heavliy depend on emotions whereas for AIs that might not be the case, so if they have a thought about getting rid of humanity they wouldnt think twice because they lack empathy unlike some humans. We wouldnt destroy AIs for having a malfuntionor a problem but rather try to find a better solution to go about things which is not the case for AIs as sugested by the statement.

However the ones to give these AIs these goals would be the humans that have developed them, so at the end of the day we would be at fault for not being more careful concidering all the things we know about AI and their intelligence levels. 

Looking at it from the perspective of the AIs, they would be doing the job they were built for, the jobs that humans gave them. They are built to do tasks that human would not be able to do as fast as AIs would or just in general humans cant do. So at them end of the day AIs wouldnt be at full fault if it were to happen because they were doing their jobs and we were incabalble beings in the way.

In conclusion, it may be true that AIs are cabable fo such things but we are the ones that developed them into these things and we are the ones that developed it to have a goal so at the end of the day, if humanity is hurt by AIs it will be our own fault.
